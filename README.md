Imperio - Electronics Store Concept

This is a simple concept website for an electronics store. Users can browse products, add them to a cart, and place orders. When an order is placed, the details are sent to a Telegram bot, so the store owner can process it safely and efficiently. The website is designed to be simple, making it easy for coders to fix or improve, and for sellers to manage.
A part of the concept is also to help the community: 10% of every order is intended to support flood relief efforts in Sri Lanka. The main idea is to show a clean, safe, and efficient way to connect users, sellers, and coders in one simple system.
